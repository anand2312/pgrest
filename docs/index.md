# pgrest-client

A Python Client library for PostgREST APIs.

This is a fork of the [Supabase Community Postgrest Client](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-py)
I am maintaining this fork with my changes for another project, that will use this under the hood.

pip install pgrest-client
```

or with Poetry

```
poetry add pgrest-client
```
