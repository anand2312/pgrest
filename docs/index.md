# pgrest-client

A Python Client library for PostgREST APIs.

!!! note
This is a fork of the [Supabase Community Postgrest Client](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-py).
I am maintaining this fork with my changes for [another project](https://anand2312.tech/r/supa-fastapi), that will use this under the hood.

## Installation

```
pip install pgrest
```

or with Poetry

```
poetry add pgrest
```

Head over to the [quickstart](quickstart.md), or the examples!
